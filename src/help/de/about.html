    OPEN-SOURCE-LIZENZ FÜR DIE EUROPÄISCHE UNION v. 1.2 
    
    EUPL © Europäische Union 2007, 2016 
    
    Diese Open-Source-Lizenz für die Europäische Union („EUPL“) gilt für Werke (im Sinne der nachfolgenden Begriffsbestimmung), die unter EUPL-Bedingungen zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Das Werk darf nur in der durch diese Lizenz gestatteten Form genutzt werden (insoweit eine solche Nutzung dem Urheber vorbehalten ist). 
    Das Werk wird unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz zur Verfügung gestellt, wenn der Lizenzgeber (im Sinne der nachfolgenden Begriffsbestimmung) den folgenden Hinweis unmittelbar hinter dem Urheberrechtshinweis dieses Werks anbringt: 
                          Lizenziert unter der EUPL 
    oder in einer anderen Form zum Ausdruck bringt, dass er es unter der EUPL lizenzieren möchte. 
    
    1.Begriffsbestimmungen 
    Für diese Lizenz gelten folgende Begriffsbestimmungen:  
    — „Lizenz“:diese Lizenz.  
    — „Originalwerk“:das Werk oder die Software, die vom Lizenzgeber unter dieser Lizenz verbreitet oder zugänglich gemacht wird, und zwar als Quellcode und gegebenenfalls auch als ausführbarer Code.  
    — „Bearbeitungen“:die Werke oder Software, die der Lizenznehmer auf der Grundlage des Originalwerks oder seiner Bearbeitungen schaffen kann. In dieser Lizenz wird nicht festgelegt, wie umfangreich die Änderung oder wie stark die Abhängigkeit vom Originalwerk für eine Einstufung als Bearbeitung sein muss; dies bestimmt sich nach dem Urheberrecht, das in dem unter Artikel 15 aufgeführten Land anwendbar ist.  
    — „Werk“:das Originalwerk oder seine Bearbeitungen.  
    — „Quellcode“:diejenige Form des Werkes, die zur Auffassung durch den Menschen bestimmt ist und die am besten geeignet ist, um vom Menschen verstanden und verändert zu werden.  
    — „Ausführbarer Code“:die — üblicherweise — kompilierte Form des Werks, die von einem Computer als Programm ausgeführt werden soll.  
    — „Lizenzgeber“:die natürliche oder juristische Person, die das Werk unter der Lizenz verbreitet oder zugänglich macht.  
    — „Bearbeiter“:jede natürliche oder juristische Person, die das Werk unter der Lizenz verändert oder auf andere Weise zur Schaffung einer Bearbeitung beiträgt.  
    — „Lizenznehmer“ („Sie“):jede natürliche oder juristische Person, die das Werk unter den Lizenzbedingungen nutzt.  
    — „Verbreitung“ oder „Zugänglichmachung“:alle Formen von Verkauf, Überlassung, Verleih, Vermietung, Verbreitung, Weitergabe, Übermittlung oder anderweitiger Online- oder Offline-Bereitstellung von Vervielfältigungen des Werks oder Zugänglichmachung seiner wesentlichen Funktionen für dritte natürliche oder juristische Personen.
    
    2.Umfang der Lizenzrechte 
    Der Lizenzgeber erteilt Ihnen hiermit für die Gültigkeitsdauer der am Originalwerk bestehenden Urheberrechte eine weltweite, unentgeltliche, nicht ausschließliche, unterlizenzierbare Lizenz, die Sie berechtigt: 
    —  das Werk uneingeschränkt zu nutzen, 
    —  das Werk zu vervielfältigen, 
    —  das Werk zu verändern und Bearbeitungen auf der Grundlage des Werks zu schaffen, 
    —  das Werk öffentlich zugänglich zu machen, was das Recht einschließt, das Werk oder Vervielfältigungsstücke davon öffentlich bereitzustellen oder wahrnehmbar zu machen oder das Werk, soweit möglich, öffentlich aufzuführen, 
    —  das Werk oder Vervielfältigungen davon zu verbreiten, 
    —  das Werk oder Vervielfältigungen davon zu vermieten oder zu verleihen, 
    —  das Werk oder Vervielfältigungen davon weiter zu lizenzieren. 
    Für die Wahrnehmung dieser Rechte können beliebige, derzeit bekannte oder künftige Medien, Träger und Formate verwendet werden, soweit das geltende Recht dem nicht entgegensteht. Für die Länder, in denen Urheberpersönlichkeitsrechte an dem Werk bestehen, verzichtet der Lizenzgeber im gesetzlich zulässigen Umfang auf seine Urheberpersönlichkeitsrechte, um die Lizenzierung der oben aufgeführten Verwertungsrechte wirksam durchführen zu können. Der Lizenzgeber erteilt dem Lizenznehmer ein nicht ausschließliches, unentgeltliches Nutzungsrecht an seinen Patenten, sofern dies zur Ausübung der durch die Lizenz erteilten Nutzungsrechte am Werk notwendig ist. 
    
    3.Zugänglichmachung des Quellcodes 
    Der Lizenzgeber kann das Werk entweder als Quellcode oder als ausführbaren Code zur Verfügung stellen. Stellt er es als ausführbaren Code zur Verfügung, so stellt er darüber hinaus eine maschinenlesbare Kopie des Quellcodes für jedes von ihm verbreitete Vervielfältigungsstück des Werks zur Verfügung, oder er verweist in einem Vermerk im Anschluss an den dem Werk beigefügten Urheberrechtshinweis auf einen Speicherort, an dem problemlos und unentgeltlich auf den Quellcode zugegriffen werden kann, solange der Lizenzgeber das Werk verbreitet oder zugänglich macht. 
    
    4.Einschränkungen des Urheberrechts
    Es ist nicht Zweck dieser Lizenz, Ausnahmen oder Schranken der ausschließlichen Rechte des Urhebers am Werk, die dem Lizenznehmer zugutekommen, einzuschränken. Auch die Erschöpfung dieser Rechte bleibt von dieser Lizenz unberührt. 
    
    5.Pflichten des Lizenznehmers 
    Die Einräumung der oben genannten Rechte ist an mehrere Beschränkungen und Pflichten für den Lizenznehmer gebunden: 
    
    Urheberrechtshinweis, Lizenztext, Nennung des Bearbeiters: Der Lizenznehmer muss alle Urheberrechts-, Patent- oder Markenrechtshinweise und alle Hinweise auf die Lizenz und den Haftungsausschluss unverändert lassen. Jedem von ihm verbreiteten oder zugänglich gemachten Vervielfältigungsstück des Werks muss der Lizenznehmer diese Hinweise sowie diese Lizenz beifügen. Der Lizenznehmer muss auf jedem abgeleiteten Werk deutlich darauf hinweisen, dass das Werk geändert wurde, und das Datum der Bearbeitung angeben.
    
    „Copyleft“-Klausel: Der Lizenznehmer darf Vervielfältigungen des Originalwerks oder Bearbeitungen nur unter den Bedingungen dieser EUPL oder einer neueren Version dieser Lizenz verbreiten oder zugänglich machen, außer wenn das Originalwerk ausdrücklich nur unter dieser Lizenzversion — z. B. mit der Angabe „Nur EUPL V. 1.2“ — verbreitet werden darf. Der Lizenznehmer (der zum Lizenzgeber wird) darf für das Werk oder die Bearbeitung keine zusätzlichen Bedingungen anbieten oder vorschreiben, die die Bedingungen dieser Lizenz verändern oder einschränken. 
    
    Kompatibilitäts-Klausel: Wenn der Lizenznehmer Bearbeitungen, die auf dem Werk und einem anderen Werk, das unter einer kompatiblen Lizenz lizenziert wurde, basieren, oder die Kopien dieser Bearbeitungen verbreitet oder zugänglich macht, kann dies unter den Bedingungen dieser kompatiblen Lizenz erfolgen. Unter „kompatibler Lizenz“ ist eine im Anhang dieser Lizenz angeführte Lizenz zu verstehen. Sollten die Verpflichtungen des Lizenznehmers aus der kompatiblen Lizenz mit denjenigen aus der vorliegenden Lizenz (EUPL) in Konflikt stehen, werden die Verpflichtungen aus der kompatiblen Lizenz Vorrang haben.
    
    Bereitstellung des Quellcodes: Wenn der Lizenznehmer Vervielfältigungsstücke des Werks verbreitet oder zugänglich macht, muss er eine maschinenlesbare Fassung des Quellcodes mitliefern oder einen Speicherort angeben, über den problemlos und unentgeltlich so lange auf diesen Quellcode zugegriffen werden kann, wie der Lizenznehmer das Werk verbreitet oder zugänglich macht. 
    
    Rechtsschutz: Diese Lizenz erlaubt nicht die Benutzung von Kennzeichen, Marken oder geschützten Namensrechten des Lizenzgebers, soweit dies nicht für die angemessene und übliche Beschreibung der Herkunft des Werks und der inhaltlichen Wiedergabe des Urheberrechtshinweises erforderlich ist.
    
    6.Urheber und Bearbeiter 
    Der ursprüngliche Lizenzgeber gewährleistet, dass er das Urheberrecht am Originalwerk innehat oder dieses an ihn lizenziert wurde und dass er befugt ist, diese Lizenz zu erteilen. 
    Jeder Bearbeiter gewährleistet, dass er das Urheberrecht an den von ihm vorgenommenen Änderungen des Werks besitzt und befugt ist, diese Lizenz zu erteilen. 
    Jedes Mal, wenn Sie die Lizenz annehmen, erteilen Ihnen der ursprüngliche Lizenzgeber und alle folgenden Bearbeiter eine Befugnis zur Nutzung ihrer Beiträge zum Werk unter den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz. 
    
    7.Gewährleistungsausschluss 
    Die Arbeit an diesem Werk wird laufend fortgeführt; es wird durch unzählige Bearbeiter ständig verbessert. Das Werk ist nicht vollendet und kann daher Fehler („bugs“) enthalten, die dieser Art der Entwicklung inhärent sind. 
    Aus den genannten Gründen wird das Werk unter dieser Lizenz „so, wie es ist“ ohne jegliche Gewährleistung zur Verfügung gestellt. Dies gilt unter anderem — aber nicht ausschließlich — für Marktreife, Verwendbarkeit für einen bestimmten Zweck, Mängelfreiheit, Richtigkeit sowie Nichtverletzung von anderen Immaterialgüterrechten als dem Urheberrecht (vgl. dazu Artikel 6 dieser Lizenz). 
    Dieser Gewährleistungsausschluss ist wesentlicher Bestandteil der Lizenz und Bedingung für die Einräumung von Rechten an dem Werk.
    
    8.Haftungsausschluss/Haftungsbeschränkung 
    Außer in Fällen von Vorsatz oder der Verursachung von Personenschäden haftet der Lizenzgeber nicht für direkte oder indirekte, materielle oder immaterielle Schäden irgendwelcher Art, die aus der Lizenz oder der Benutzung des Werks folgen; dies gilt unter anderem, aber nicht ausschließlich, für Firmenwertverluste, Produktionsausfall, Computerausfall oder Computerfehler, Datenverlust oder wirtschaftliche Schäden, und zwar auch dann, wenn der Lizenzgeber auf die Möglichkeit solcher Schäden hingewiesen wurde. Unabhängig davon haftet der Lizenzgeber im Rahmen der gesetzlichen Produkthaftung, soweit die entsprechenden Regelungen auf das Werk anwendbar sind. 
    
    9.Zusatzvereinbarungen 
    Wenn Sie das Werk verbreiten, können Sie Zusatzvereinbarungen schließen, in denen Verpflichtungen oder Dienstleistungen festgelegt werden, die mit dieser Lizenz vereinbar sind. Sie dürfen Verpflichtungen indessen nur in Ihrem eigenen Namen und auf Ihre eigene Verantwortung eingehen, nicht jedoch im Namen des ursprünglichen Lizenzgebers oder eines anderen Bearbeiters, und nur, wenn Sie sich gegenüber allen Bearbeitern verpflichten, sie zu entschädigen, zu verteidigen und von der Haftung freizustellen, falls aufgrund der von Ihnen eingegangenen Gewährleistungsverpflichtung oder Haftungsübernahme Forderungen gegen sie geltend gemacht werden oder eine Haftungsverpflichtung entsteht. 
    
    10.Annahme der Lizenz 
    Sie können den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz zustimmen, indem Sie das Symbol „Lizenz annehmen“ unter dem Fenster mit dem Lizenztext anklicken oder indem Sie Ihre Zustimmung auf vergleichbare Weise in einer nach anwendbarem Recht zulässigen Form geben. Das Anklicken des Symbols gilt als Anzeichen Ihrer eindeutigen und unwiderruflichen Annahme der Lizenz und der darin enthaltenen Klauseln und Bedingungen. In gleicher Weise gilt als Zeichen der eindeutigen und unwiderruflichen Zustimmung die Ausübung eines Rechtes, das in Artikel 2 dieser Lizenz angeführt ist, wie das Erstellen einer Bearbeitung oder die Verbreitung oder Zugänglichmachung des Werks oder dessen Vervielfältigungen. 
    
    11.Informationspflichten
    Wenn Sie das Werk verbreiten oder zugänglich machen (beispielsweise, indem Sie es zum Herunterladen von einer Website anbieten), müssen Sie über den Vertriebskanal oder das benutzte Verbreitungsmedium der Öffentlichkeit zumindest jene Informationen bereitstellen, die nach dem anwendbaren Recht bezüglich der Lizenzgeber, der Lizenz und ihrer Zugänglichkeit, des Abschlusses des Lizenzvertrags sowie darüber, wie die Lizenz durch den Lizenznehmer gespeichert und vervielfältigt werden kann, erforderlich sind.
    
    12.Beendigung der Lizenz 
    Die Lizenz und die damit eingeräumten Rechte erlöschen automatisch, wenn der Lizenznehmer gegen die Lizenzbedingungen verstößt. Ein solches Erlöschen der Lizenz führt nicht zum Erlöschen der Lizenzen von Personen, denen das Werk vom Lizenznehmer unter dieser Lizenz zur Verfügung gestellt worden ist, solange diese Personen die Lizenzbedingungen erfüllen. 
    13.Sonstiges
    Unbeschadet des Artikels 9 stellt die Lizenz die vollständige Vereinbarung der Parteien über das Werk dar. Sind einzelne Bestimmungen der Lizenz nach geltendem Recht nichtig oder unwirksam, so berührt dies nicht die Wirksamkeit oder Durchsetzbarkeit der Lizenz an sich. Solche Bestimmungen werden vielmehr so ausgelegt oder modifiziert, dass sie wirksam und durchsetzbar sind. Die Europäische Kommission kann weitere Sprachfassungen oder neue Versionen dieser Lizenz oder aktualisierte Fassungen des Anhangs veröffentlichen, soweit dies notwendig und angemessen ist, ohne den Umfang der Lizenzrechte zu verringern. Neue Versionen werden mit einer eindeutigen Versionsnummer veröffentlicht. Alle von der Europäischen Kommission anerkannten Sprachfassungen dieser Lizenz sind gleichwertig. Die Parteien können sich auf die Sprachfassung ihrer Wahl berufen.
    
    14.Gerichtsstand
    Unbeschadet besonderer Vereinbarungen zwischen den Parteien gilt Folgendes: 
    —  Für alle Streitigkeiten über die Auslegung dieser Lizenz zwischen den Organen, Einrichtungen und sonstigen Stellen der Europäischen Union als Lizenzgeber und einem Lizenznehmer ist der Gerichtshof der Europäischen Union gemäß Artikel 272 des Vertrags über die Arbeitsweise der Europäischen Union zuständig; 
    —  Gerichtsstand für Streitigkeiten zwischen anderen Parteien über die Auslegung dieser Lizenz ist allein der Ort, an dem der Lizenzgeber seinen Wohnsitz oder den wirtschaftlichen Mittelpunkt seiner Tätigkeit hat. 
    
    15.Anwendbares Recht
    Unbeschadet besonderer Vereinbarungen zwischen den Parteien gilt Folgendes: 
    —  Diese Lizenz unterliegt dem Recht des Mitgliedstaats der Europäischen Union, in dem der Lizenzgeber seinen Sitz, Wohnsitz oder eingetragenen Sitz hat; 
    —  diese Lizenz unterliegt dem belgischen Recht, wenn der Lizenzgeber keinen Sitz, Wohnsitz oder eingetragenen Sitz in einem Mitgliedstaat der Europäischen Union hat.
       
    Anlage 
    „Kompatible Lizenzen“ nach Artikel 5 der EUPL sind: 
    —  GNU General Public License (GPL) v. 2, v. 3

       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
    
       1. Definitions.
    
          "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
          and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
    
          "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
          the copyright owner that is granting the License.
    
          "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
          other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
          control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
          "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
          direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
          otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
          outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
    
          "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
          exercising permissions granted by this License.
    
          "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

          source, and configuration files.
    
          "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
          transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
          not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

          "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
          Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
          copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
          (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
    
          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
          editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
          represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
          of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
          separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
    
          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
          the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

          the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
          means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
          to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
          communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

          excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
          designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
    
          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
          on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.
    
       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
          Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
    
       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.
    
       4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
          meet the following conditions:
    
          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
    
          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that You changed the files; and
    
          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
              the Derivative Works; and
    
          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.
    
          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.
    
       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
    
       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
    
       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
    
       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    
       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
    
       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
       APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
    
          To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
          boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
          replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
          the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
          comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
          file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
          same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
          identification within third-party archives.
