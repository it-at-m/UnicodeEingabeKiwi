    EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC LICENCE v. 1.2 
    EUPL © the European Union 2007, 2016 
    
    This European Union Public Licence (the ‘EUPL’) applies to the Work (as defined below) which is provided under the 
    terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such 
    use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work). 
    The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined below) has placed the following 
    notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Work: 
                              Licensed under the EUPL 
    or has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the EUPL. 
    
    1.Definitions 
    In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning: 
    — ‘The Licence’:this Licence. 
    — ‘The Original Work’:the work or software distributed or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available 
    as Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be. 
    — ‘Derivative Works’:the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based upon the Original Work or 
    modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work 
    required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in 
    the country mentioned in Article 15. 
    — ‘The Work’:the Original Work or its Derivative Works. 
    — ‘The Source Code’:the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and 
    modify. 
    — ‘The Executable Code’:any code which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted by 
    a computer as a program. 
    — ‘The Licensor’:the natural or legal person that distributes or communicates the Work under the Licence. 
    — ‘Contributor(s)’:any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to 
    the creation of a Derivative Work. 
    — ‘The Licensee’ or ‘You’:any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Work under the terms of the 
    Licence. 
    — ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’:any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, 
    transmitting, or otherwise making available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential 
    functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal person. 
    
    2.Scope of the rights granted by the Licence 
    The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for 
    the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work: 
    — use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, 
    — reproduce the Work, 
    — modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, 
    — communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public 
    and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, 
    — distribute the Work or copies thereof, 
    — lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, 
    — sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof. 
    Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the 
    applicable law permits so. 
    In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed 
    by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed. 
    The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the 
    extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence. 
    
    3.Communication of the Source Code 
    The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as 
    Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with 
    each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to 
    the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to 
    distribute or communicate the Work. 
    
    4.Limitations on copyright 
    Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the 
    exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations 
    thereto. 
    
    5.Obligations of the Licensee 
    The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those 
    obligations are the following: 
    
    Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to 
    the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the 
    Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work 
    to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification. 
    
    Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works, this 
    Distribution or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless 
    the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence — for example by communicating 
    ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the 
    Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence. 
    
    Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both 
    the Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done 
    under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, ‘Compatible Licence’ refers to the licences listed 
    in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with 
    his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail. 
    
    Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide 
    a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available 
    for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work. 
    Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names 
    of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and 
    reproducing the content of the copyright notice. 
    
    6.Chain of Authorship 
    The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or 
    licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence. 
    Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or 
    licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence. 
    Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions 
    to the Work, under the terms of this Licence. 
    
    7.Disclaimer of Warranty 
    The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work 
    and may therefore contain defects or ‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development. 
    For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’ basis and without warranties of any kind 
    concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or 
    errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this 
    Licence. 
    This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work. 
    
    8.Disclaimer of Liability 
    Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be 
    liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the 
    Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss 
    of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, 
    the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work. 
    
    9.Additional agreements 
    While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement, defining obligations or services 
    consistent with this Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole 
    responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by 
    the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability. 
    
    10.Acceptance of the Licence 
    The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I agree’ placed under the bottom of a window 
    displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of 
    applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms 
    and conditions. 
    Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You 
    by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution 
    or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof. 
    
    11.Information to the public 
    In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You (for example, 
    by offering to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) 
    must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence 
    and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee. 
    
    12.Termination of the Licence 
    The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms 
    of the Licence. 
    Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under 
    the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence. 
    
    13.Miscellaneous 
    Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the 
    Work. 
    If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or 
    enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it valid 
    and enforceable. 
    The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions of this Licence or updated versions of 
    the Appendix, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. 
    New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number. 
    All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take 
    advantage of the linguistic version of their choice. 
    
    14.Jurisdiction 
    Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties, 
    — any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European Union institutions, 
    bodies, offices or agencies, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice 
    of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 
    — any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to 
    the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business. 
    
    15.Applicable Law 
    Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties, 
    — this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State where the Licensor has his seat, 
    resides or has his registered office, 
    — this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat, residence or registered office inside 
    a European Union Member State. 
    
    
                                                             Appendix

          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

          of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
          separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

          the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
          means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
          to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
          on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.

          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.
    
       4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
          meet the following conditions:
    
          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
    
          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that You changed the files; and
    
          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
              the Derivative Works; and
    
          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.
    
          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.
    
       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
    
       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
    
       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
    
       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    
       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
    
       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
       APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
    
          To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
          boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
          replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
          the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
          comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
          file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
          same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
          identification within third-party archives.
